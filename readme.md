# Snipper landing page

Landing page for code snippets app built with tailwindcss. This is a one of challenges from Codewell coding platform. I've built this page from scratch using starter files from Codewell.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
